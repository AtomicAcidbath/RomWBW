Scott's Notes

The 8inch drives as received were configured:
   842 - cut X, Z, HL; short C

Reconfigured for me:
   842 - cut B, HL; short C 
            head load from pin 18
            stepper motor always energized
            (short DS-near-J2 to only energize stepper motor on drive select)

Modifications to 34-50 adapter
   route NC6 to HL

Modifications to floppy controller
   route HL to NC6
